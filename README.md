All this talk of living in virtue
while it's unclear what that amounts to 
and what we hold dear is bound to desert you
because the day's cues are always made brand new

we'll be wet with permanent rain soon
the rich (are okay) can (vacation) (dry out) in cancun
But i smile cuz i like the green and the grey view.
