All this talk of living in virtue
while it's unclear what that amounts to 
and what we hold dear is bound to desert you
because the day's cues are always made brand new

we'll be wet with permanent rain soon //
the rich (are okay) can (vacation) (dry out) in cancun //
But i smile cuz i like the green and the grey view. //
// as lana said, sun can't cure the blues //
