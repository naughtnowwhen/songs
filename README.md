// practicing gitWorkflow 

All this talk of living in virtue //
while it's unclear what that amounts to //
and what we hold dear is bound to desert you //
because the day's cues are always made brand new //

revised lines to bullied actors //
thinking today, i'll please the director  //
but we're so wrong, he's the theater master //
cuz the grand plot, (is all that he's after) //
                    (is all that he cares for) // 

ourselves, we keep giving birth to //
nursed by those who'll praise and will curse you... //

hate to admit, but i need a curfew //
the noon and the night I always blow through //

(the strangers that you perform to.)

your own thoughts the riders that spurs you //
the cowboys (drivers) cruel, but we keep giving rides to //

the firm ground, a mirage that we pray to //
wear boots, cuz it's a swamp that we wade through. //

I must be so hot because i keep coming unglued. //
