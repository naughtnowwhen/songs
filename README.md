All this talk of living in virtue
while it's unclear what that amounts to 
and what we hold dear is bound to desert you
because the day's cues are always made brand new

revised lines to bullied actors
thinking today, i'll please the director 
but we're so wrong, he's the theater master
cuz the grand plot, (is all that he's after)
                    (is all that he cares for)

believe me, we're being lied to //
and worse still, the deceit is inside us //
you look long cuz the mirror entices //
but you notice, that your ugly is widespread //
And in a sudden you laugh //

( maybe the first time through it's short and just goes right to caught in the act, but then later choruses expand to include more lines like below, there's something to both ways, and that seems like a reliable song device)

(caught in the act)
(catching yourself being caught in the act) //
(catching yourself as you walk right into the trap.) //

// something bridgey about this and relates to the battle theme//

i walk soft, but it's on eggshells //
the big stick at my side seems pretty helpless //
cuz you're brandishing a gun! //
our terror is your fun //
