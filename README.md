All this talk of living in virtue
while it's unclear what that amounts to 
and what we hold dear is bound to desert you
because the day's cues are always made brand new

wolf grey, rooting for uniforms //
i look down and see i'm in one of em //
sore throats from the pivotal third down //
make room for defeat in your (battle) (contingent) plan //
