// practicing gitWorkflow 

All this talk of living in virtue //
while it's unclear what that amounts to // 
and what we hold dear is bound to desert you //
because the day's cues are always made brand new //

chill out bro, put down the sun tzu //
i call truce on this conquering attitude //
with a look in the eye my body gets sliced through //
no shock there, were just water and firm ooze //

my big plans, lost in the turmoil //
the victors a fool for the spoils he fought for //

// no we should retreat with the army we came with //
to the safety of the of the low lying foothools //
there we can rethink these bloody tactics
for to bleed dry no one enlisted //

// i like this idea but it needs to be refactored
// or have a unique scheme like a bridge or something.

and cast off the fake glory of combat //
let ackbar pull rank cuz he was wise and succinct //
to notice that it's a trap into which we'll all sink //
