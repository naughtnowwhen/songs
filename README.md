All this talk of living in virtue
while it's unclear what that amounts to 
and what we hold dear is bound to desert you
because the day's cues are always made brand new

revised lines to bullied actors
thinking today, i'll please the director 
but we're so wrong, he's the theater master
cuz the grand plot, (is all that he's after)
                    (is all that he cares for)

i'm so shy, that it's a problem
But here i'm ignored and it makes me feel welcome
